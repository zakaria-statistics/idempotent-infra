# VM-Based Kubernetes Infrastructure with Ansible

This project automates the setup of a lightweight Kubernetes infrastructure using Virtual Machines and Ansible.

## ðŸ§© Overview

This repository provides an automated approach to:

1. **Provision VMs** with appropriate resources and roles:
   - Ansible control VM:
     - 2 CPUs, 2 GB RAM
     - Private network with static IP `192.168.56.20`
     - Syncs the `ansible/` directory for playbooks and scripts
   - Kubernetes cluster VM:
     - 8 CPUs, 4 GB RAM, 50 GB disk (if `vagrant-disksize` plugin installed)
     - Private network with static IP `192.168.56.10`
     - Folder sync disabled for performance and security

2. **Set up secure SSH access** for Ansible to control the Kubernetes VM:
   - Shares user's public SSH key for passwordless login
   - Sets appropriate permissions for SSH keys

3. **Configure the Kubernetes VM using Ansible playbooks and scripts**:
   - Network configuration with Netplan and DNS setup
   - Container runtime installation and configuration (`containerd`)
   - Kubernetes components installation: `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl`
   - Kubernetes cluster initialization and startup scripts
   - Calico CNI plugin deployment with necessary modifications
